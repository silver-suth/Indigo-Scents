# Indigo-Scents
Indigo Scents is an artisan candle company that was established in 2012 and located in the
  downtown area of Jackson Tennessee. Indigo Scents is owned by Christal King, a native of Hampton
  Virginia, and her husband L. Leon King, a Tennessee native and USAF Veteran. Growing up on the East
  Coast by the ocean and in a town full of fruit trees, flowers, and wild berries, is where Christal
  developed the love for nature and it's many beautiful aromas! Those aromas are the inspirations behind Indigo Scents.

  Our website was created by William Hudson, Zachary Roberts, and Adam Sutherland.

  Our initial goal going into this was to make our website look unique. Rather than doing the same thing most common
  retail cites do, we went for a different look. The Hero Images on the Index page and the store Links pages give the
  cite a unique feel the Nav Bar at the top of every page features a uniquely styled button and dropdown that sets apart
  our websites from the rest.

  On the Products page, rather than dully displaying every scent on each product's own individual page as most cites do,
  we placed them in dropdowns and and linked the buttons to individual modals for every scent.

  The Sign In or Register page utilizes modals as well. The Connect With Us page allows you to enter any questions you
  have in a text-box and submit them to an email we created. This page also features the location of the business via a
  google maps iframe. Finally the Cart page allows you to increase and decrease the number of a certain product you wish
  to buy and the price is linearly related to that number.

  Thank you for taking the time to check out our website, we really appreciate it!
