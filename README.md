# Indigo-Scents
We have everything formatted and thoroughly commented.
Zach will be completing the Connect With Us page over the weekend and through Thanksgiving break
William will be completing the Cart page over the weekend and through Thanksgiving break
Adam will be completing the Sign in or Register page over the weekend and through Thanksgiving break
after fall break we will all pitch in to create the Store Links page


At some point you will need to delete the indextest pages if you are done with them.
Looks like you still have a lot of info to put into the products page. I would concentrate on that.
Also need to concentrate on the links in the dropdown that only say "link"
Your code is REALLY clean and easy to read with good comments.
